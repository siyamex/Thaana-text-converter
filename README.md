How I Built a Thaana Converter App using html, css and js

Overview of the App
The app has a simple interface with two text areas:
Input Field: Where users type English characters.
Output Field: Displays the corresponding Thaana script in real-time.
Using JavaScript, the app converts English letters into Thaana script based on a predefined mapping.
